# Sudoku Solver Web Page

This web page allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle and view the solved solution. The solution algorithm is available in three different programming languages: JavaScript, C++, and Python.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Download the files `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
   
2. **Organize Files:**
   - Ensure all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`) are in the same folder.

3. **Open HTML File:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

4. **Fill the Sudoku Grid:**
   - Input the Sudoku puzzle into the grid provided.

5. **Upload Sudoku Grid:**
   - Click on the "UPLOAD" button to submit the Sudoku grid.

6. **View Solution:**
   - After uploading, click on the "VIEW SOLUTION" button to get the solved Sudoku.

## Algorithm Files

### JavaScript (script.js)

- The JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains the Sudoku solving algorithm implemented in JavaScript. This file can be used directly with the web page.

### C++ (sudoku.cpp)

- The C++ file (`sudoku.cpp`) contains the Sudoku solving algorithm implemented in C++. It serves as a reference for understanding the algorithm in C++ but is not intended for linking with the webpage.

### Python (sudokuSolve.py)

- The Python file (`sudokuSolve.py`) contains the Sudoku solving algorithm implemented in Python. Like the C++ file, it is a reference for understanding the algorithm in Python and is not meant for linking with the webpage.

## Future Goals

- (`contour.ipynb`) contains trained model for converting image of sudoku grid to 2-D array.

## Important Note

- The C++ and Python files are provided as reference implementations of the Sudoku solving algorithm. They are not meant to be integrated with the web page directly.
